## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **npm** >= 9
- **MongoDB Atlas** connection string (configured in env files)
- **shell-services** must be running (issues JWT tokens verified by this service)

### Environment Variables

Config is loaded from `env/.env.{NODE_ENV}` files:

```env
PORT=8001
NODE_ENV=local
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...@matchdb.rhutf6s.mongodb.net/matchdb-jobs?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=dev-jwt-secret-change-in-production-min-32-chars
SENDGRID_API_KEY=
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001,http://localhost:4000,http://localhost:4001
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

> **Note:** `JWT_SECRET` must match the one used in `matchdb-shell-services` since tokens are issued there and verified here.

### Install & Run

```powershell
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start the dev server (hot-reload)
npm run dev
```

The server starts on **http://localhost:8001**.
